Problem statement
You are required to build a user authentication system for a web application Using the IIFE.

Requirements

Create an empty array of objects with name users to store registered users.
The IIFE should return two functions.
registerUser: It should take two parameters "username" and "password" and add it to the users array.
The array should be of the form:
[{username: "user1 ", password: "pwd1 "},
{username: " user2", password: "pwd2 "},
....]

Call the checkCredentials function to determine if the user is already present in the users array.

If the user is already registered then return `The user is already registered` otherwise push the user object to the Users array and return `The user have been added to the registeredUser array`.  
checkCredentials: It should take two arguments, "username" and "password", and check whether the user with the given credentials is present in the user's array or not. It should return false if the user is not present otherwise true.

Input:

userAuth.registerUser('testuser', 'password123');
userAuth.registerUser('testuser','password123');

Output:

The user have been added to the registeredUser array
The user is already registered
